   Spermine is a natural polyamine found in all eucaryotes, and certain bacteria and viruses. In procaryotes, this polyamine is an essential growth factor for bacterias1 and a stabilizer of the helical structure of DNA when itâ€™s associated with nucleic acids for viruses2. In eucaryotes, the spermine is present in several cellular metabolisms in different types of tissues, for example, the phosphorylation of protein3.
Today, spermine has many uses such as a cosmetic ingredient for moisturizing products (to close pores or reduce wrinkles)4, and a raw material for synthesizing derivatives of medical interest.
Recently, Spermine has demonstrated strong clinical relevance in various human cancers and benign diseases5, and the potential to become a promising therapeutic agent to treat ocular diseases such as glaucoma, optic nerve injury, and cataracts6. Besides, its acetylated effects on tubulins might be used to develop treatments for prion diseases. In effect, recent studies show that increasing acetylation of tubulins may facilitate autophagic degradation of prion aggregate7.
